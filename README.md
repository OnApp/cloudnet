[ ![Codeship Status for OnApp/cloudnet](https://codeship.com/projects/6e11e150-aeee-0132-a36c-2a23891ee2d0/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/69018)

#Control Panel for Cloud.net

[Cloud.net](https://cloud.net) is an end user interface to [OnApp](http://onapp.com/)'s cloud provisioning platform.

Cloud.net is the first truly transparent marketplace for global cloud infrastructure. You can deploy servers on clouds all over the world, get independently-verified data about price, performance and uptime, and manage everything through one control panel.

You will find this repository useful if you have your own installation of OnApp and want to offer paid cloud hosting through a more traditional interface.

##Installation

The recommended installation method is with [Docker](http://www.docker.com). Although traditional
methods should also work, see `Dockerfile` and this README as a guide.

**Dependencies**    
Cloud.net has various dependencies;
  * [OnApp](http://onapp.com/platform/pricing-packages/): cloud provision
  * [Postgres](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides): main database
  * [Redis](http://redis.io/): message queuing
  * [Memcache](http://memcached.org/): caching
  * [Zendesk API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/core/introduction#content): customer support
  * [Maxmind API](http://dev.maxmind.com/): credit card fraud detection
  * [Segment API](https://segment.com/): custom analytics
  * [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/welcome/): exception logging
  * [Stripe API](https://stripe.com): payment gateway
  * [500PX API](http://developers.500px.com/): photo library
  * [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/): displaying maps
  * An SMTP mail server, eg [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/), [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/), etc.

You will need to either install or register API keys for all these dependencies.

**Building/retrieving the Cloud.net Docker image**    
You can either pull the latest image from the Docker registry with `docker pull Onapp/cloudnet`

Or build the image yourself. First make sure you have the repo with
`git clone https://github.com/OnApp/cloudnet` then run `docker build -t cloudnet .`

**Initial config**    
Firstly you will need to populate the `dotenv.sample` file and rename it to `.env`

Generate symmetric encryption key `docker run --env-file=.env --rm cloudnet rails generate symmetric_encryption:new_keys production`.That KEY will need to be added to the `SYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` setting in `.env`.

Then create the OnApp user role that grants restricted permissions to Cloud.net users and make a note
of the created ID;
`docker run --env-file=.env --rm cloudnet rake create_onapp_role`.
That ID will need to be added to the `ONAPP_ROLE` setting in `.env`.

Then create the database and structure with 

`docker run --env-file=.env --rm cloudnet rake db:schema:create` 

`docker run --env-file=.env --rm cloudnet rake db:schema:load`.

And finally seed the database with `docker run --env-file=.env --rm cloudnet rake db:seed`. This will
add the available providers from your OnApp installation and an initial admin user with
email: 'admin@cloud.net' and password: 'adminpassword'.

You will then need to change the admin password and fill out the extra details for the providers
that your installation is offering. For instance each provider needs a price per disk/cpu/memory.
You can edit these details through the admin interface at `/admin/locations`.

**Running the Docker containers**    
You will need at least 2 containers:

Note that the web server is set to use HTTPS, so you will need to provide SSL certificates using
the `-v` (mount argument) as shown in the `docker run` comman below. The certificates must be named;
`server.key` and `server.crt`.

  * Web container:
```
docker run \
  --env-file=.env \
  -p 443:3443 \
  -v /local/path/to/ssl-keys:/mnt/certs \
  --restart=always \
  --name cloudnet-web \
  --detach \
  cloudnet foreman run web
```

NB. This web process will only accept HTTPS traffic

  * Worker container:
```
docker run \
  --env-file=.env \
  --restart=always \
  --name cloudnet-worker \
  --detach \
  cloudnet foreman run sidekiq --logfile /dev/stdout
```

##TODO
Document scaling with Docker using a [Swarm](http://docs.docker.com/swarm/) and a load balancer.
